# Tests to check your controllers are called *functional tests*. When you tested your models, 
 # you didn’t test them in the context of the web application—there were no web requests and
 # responses nor were there any URLs to contend with. 
 # This focused approach lets you hone in on the specific functionality of the model and test it in isolation.
